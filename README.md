# WebtechProject
This is a college leval miniproject for the subject of "Web Technologies" 
We were free to implement any website of our choice.
For the perpose of this project we have selected "D-Vision " which is a freelance or contract based photo studio 
exceling in wedding album, portfolio and all the other kind of photo/video graphy needs.
By using HTML-JAVASCRIPT-PHP-CSS this website can allow end users to navigate through it while maintaining 
streamlined flow and feel of website with components and animations like photo counter , slideshow , i-frame for google map etc.
An admin login page is also designed for maintaining and editing stories to be displayed on website , which is only accessible by 
proper ID and Password.

Apart from simply glancing over the contacting details of studio, End-users can also navigate to "Book an Apointment" and 
enter their E-mail to get a Date and time slot booked in their name in automated System generated mail.

This projrct is kept open-source to be of help and to be used as reference by students of web designing based subject.
FIN.
